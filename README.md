# Webpack Playground

A basic setup for a local playground when CodePen just isn't cutting it.

Based off of the [webpack-starter-basic](https://github.com/lifenautjoe/webpack-starter-basic). See that repo for options that may be of interest (loading fonts, images, or bootstrap).

## Usage

Install npm dependencies

```sh
 npm install 
```

Run the kickstart command
```sh
npm run kickstart
```

**After the project has been kickstarted**

To start the development server

```sh
npm start
```

To build for production

```sh
npm run build
```

To preview the production build
```sh
npm run preview
```
